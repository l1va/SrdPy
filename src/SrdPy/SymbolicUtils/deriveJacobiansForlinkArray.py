        # velocity tensor)

        # There are two eq. of interest for angular velocity
        # tensor;
        # first: (0)W = dT*T' where T is the matrix of directional
        # cosines for a local frame (basis), dT is its derivative,
        # (0)W denotes W expressed in the world frame;
        # second: (l)W = T'*dT, (1)W denotes W expressed in the local
        # frame. The following equality also holds:
        # (0)W = T*(l)W*T';
        #
        # For finding kinetic energy we need (l)W, because the tensor
        # of inertia will be expressed in the local frame.
